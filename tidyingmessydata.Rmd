```{r setup, include=FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(echo = TRUE)
```

Initial Setup

## if you want to keep only markdown and get GitHub-flavored markdown, use output: github_document above
## If there are R chunks that make figures, the usage of markdown output formats will also cause those figure files to be left behind in a sensibly named sub-directory such as foo_files.
## If you commit and push foo.md and everything inside foo_files, then anyone with permission to view your GitHub repo can see a decent-looking version of your report.

## R Markdown

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
